        My name is William, computer science graduate from the University of
        Calgary. It wasnâ€™t until my fourth year that I truly found a passion in
        web development and decided to pursue a career in this field. Since
        graduating I have helped local businesses develop static to full stack
        websites. I hope to expand my knowledge within this field and be able to
        solve complex problems through programming.
        <p>I am currently open to any web development opportunities!</p>
